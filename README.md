Battleship Game in Python
=============================

This is a quick game I made in Python to experiment while learning on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) the basics of the language. 
There are still many bugs which need to be fixed. I'll try to address most of them in the coming days.

Have fun with it!
